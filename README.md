**Description**

We chose to use the dataset from "Phone Information 2024". Using the Processing application, we will create a data visualization focused on the following:

1. A bar chart displaying the range of prices, with options to view the mean, median, and mode as data is adjusted directly from each bar in the chart.

2. A pie chart showing the top 10 best-selling mobile brands, highlighting the most popular and recognized ones in the market. Additionally, this chart allows for easy adjustment of sales figures for each brand as data updates.

3. Devices are divided into two categories: high-end and low-end, to facilitate comparison. On the right side of the screen, high-end devices are displayed, which include phones with more than 16 GB of RAM and over 512 GB of storage. In contrast, low-end devices are shown on the left side, consisting of phones with less than 4 GB of RAM and under 64 GB of storage. Additionally, sound adjusts proportionally to the number of devices in each category, with the side containing more phones sounding louder.

Once the data is visualized, it can be adjusted using both the mouse and keyboard, as well as through Pure Data Extended, which also enables sonification of this data.

**Applications**
- Pure Data Extended
- Processing
- R (for data cleaning)
